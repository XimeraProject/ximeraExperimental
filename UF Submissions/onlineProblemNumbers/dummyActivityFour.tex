\title{Dummy Activity for Experimental Branch 4}
\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
    Just a dummy activity to demo new features on experimental branch.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

This is an example activity that is using the ximera-class option:
\begin{itemize}
    \item numbers
    \item onlineProblemNumbers
\end{itemize}

So we should see numbering on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Activities
    \item Problems online (the pdf normally has numbers regardless I believe).
\end{itemize}
